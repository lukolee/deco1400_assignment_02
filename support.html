                        When on the browsing page this button will allow you to filter patterns by those that you can crochet based on the yarn that you have added to your catalogue.

                    <p>
                        To add yarn to your catalogue click the <em>my yarn</em> button in the header and add that which you have in your collection.

                        To use the step mode simply click <em>Begin Crochet Mode</em> when previewing a pattern to enter the mode. The "back" and <em>next</em> buttons in the header allow you to go to the next or previous steps.
